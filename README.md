## Shift Offer Analysis â€“ Worker Behavior & Pay Optimization

This project analyzes shift offer data from a mobile healthcare staffing platform, where each record represents a unique instance of a worker viewing a shift with a specific pay rate, time, and location. Unlike a traditional shift table, each row corresponds to a personalized offer generated in real-time, not a unique shift itself.

The goal of this analysis was to explore worker behavior in response to pay rates and other shift attributes, evaluate conversion outcomes (e.g., bookings, cancellations, no-shows), and identify opportunities to optimize fill rates and pricing strategies. Insights from the project can inform dynamic pay recommendations and better demand-supply alignment.
